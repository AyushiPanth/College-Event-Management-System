# College-Event-Management-System

College Event Management System is a simplistic platform for event management, whether it is event details to be seen by the user or the overall event control by the admin, it provides a platform for both the end-users to stay tuned with the events.

Initiated with the incentive to provide a common rostrum to host all college events, College Event Management System is basically a platform where people can host their events and promote them for the students within the institute. A club has to just create his/her account, then login to host the event and manage it as per the requirements. The entire process will save a lot of time along with providing a better reach to the participants.

## Features:
- There will be three users - admin, club, and students
- Clubs can open an event in the system and manage it.
- The created event will be sent to the admin for permission.
- SMS or Mail of the event can be sent to registered students.
- List and details of past, present, and future events along with RSVP.
- Blog on events can also be submitted and displayed regarding a particular event.
- There will be other events sections where events from other colleges are visible.
